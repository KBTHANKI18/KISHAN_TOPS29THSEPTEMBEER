Q-43 Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?
A-43 We use zip() method to simplify the code when we need to iterate over two or more lists at the same time. 
     Instead of using a for loop to iterate over each list separately, we can use zip() to iterate over both lists simultaneously.
     The zip() method can also be used to create a dictionary from two lists, where one list contains keys and the other list contains
     values.
