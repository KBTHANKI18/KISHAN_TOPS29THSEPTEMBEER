Q-18  What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.
A-18  A tuple is a collection of ordered, immutable elements enclosed in parentheses () and separated by commas.
      Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements.
      Lists are mutable, which means you can add, remove, or modify elements after the list has been created. Tuples, on the other hand,
      are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements
      Lists are defined using square brackets [], while tuples are defined using parentheses ().
      Example of a list
      my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
      Example of a tuple
      my_tuple = (1, 'two', 3.0, [4, 5])
