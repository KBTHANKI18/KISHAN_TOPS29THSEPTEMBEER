Q-52 How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python? 
A-52 There are two basic types of functions available in Python:
     Built-in functions: These are the functions that are already defined in Python and can be used directly without any need
     for defining them. Examples include print(), len(), range(), etc.
     User-defined functions: These are the functions that are defined by the user to perform a specific task. 
     They can be called multiple times within a program, and they improve the reusability of the code.
