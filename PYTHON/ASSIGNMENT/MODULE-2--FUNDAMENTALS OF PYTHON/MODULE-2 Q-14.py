Q-14 What are negative indexes and why are they used?
A-14 The negative indexing is the act of indexing from the end of the list with indexing starting at -1 i.e. -1 gives the last element of list, -2 gives the 
     second last element of list and so on.
     Negative Indexing is used in Python to begin slicing from the end of the string i.e. the last. 
     Slicing gets a sub-string from a string. The slicing range is set as parameters i.e. start, stop and step.
